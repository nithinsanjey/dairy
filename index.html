			<span id="dropcap">W</span>elcome to the dairy of me. I recently watch a movie named "The Social Network" in which Jesse Eisenberg used to blog his feeling in his blog daily. And I have always thought of maintaining a dairy. So inspired from these coincidences I thought of making a template for me to write my own dairy and finally ended up with this one.

			Doing so also helped me to try new professional looking google fonts into my html, which I have not done previously. And searching through <a href="http://demosthenes.info/">Dudley Storey's blog</a> for making the dropcaps for the first letter. It also introduced me with new pseudo-classes such as first-of-type and first-letter. And really it would me nice if initial-caps come alive. The top stripe of green was inspired from <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> .

			I think this is enough for sample content. Hope you enjoy my design. Feel free to fork with your designs. Have fun!!
